### `python-flask`

  - [ ] `python-flask`: Currently, when running Docker locally, it is sometimes super slow to load pages. I need to look into this.
  - [ ] `c-sharp-razor`: In Stage 3 of the the Dockerfile Publish the application I'm using a self-contained, optimized version of the application `FROM build AS publish`, is that a problem and do we ensure a fair comparison against the other applications?
