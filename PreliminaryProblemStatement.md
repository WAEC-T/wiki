This thesis will investigate and compare the energy consumption of different programming languages and their associated 
frameworks used to develop a minimal micro-blogging web application, similar to Twitter. The study will be conducted 
on a standardized platform to ensure consistent and reliable measurements. The primary focus will be on evaluating 
the energy efficiency and performance of these languages and frameworks in implementing the web application. 
In addition, the study will standardize the applications across languages to ensure a fair comparison. The goal is to 
provide software engineers with insight into the selection of programming languages and frameworks based on energy 
efficiency and to establish a reliable methodology for measuring the energy consumption of web applications.
