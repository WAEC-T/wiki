### Title:

**Option 1: Energy Efficiency in Web Development: A Comparative Analysis of Programming Languages and Frameworks**

**Option 2: Evaluating the Energy Efficiency of Programming Languages and Frameworks in Web Application Development**

### Preliminary Problem Statement:

This thesis will investigate and compare the energy consumption of different programming languages and their associated frameworks used to develop a minimal micro-blogging web application, similar to Twitter. The study will be conducted through empirical lab experiments in a controlled environment to ensure consistent and reliable measurements. The primary focus will be on evaluating the energy efficiency and performance of these languages and frameworks in implementing the web application. In addition, the study will ensure that each web application is implemented according to the standard practices for the given frameworks associated with each language to allow for a fair comparison. The goal is to provide software engineers with insight into the selection of programming languages and frameworks based on energy efficiency and to establish a reliable methodology for measuring the energy consumption of web applications.
